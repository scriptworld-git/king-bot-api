# docker

there is also a docker image for this bot.  
create a folder for the database and a file (`cred.txt`) with your credentials in this folder that can be mounted to the docker container.  
`sitter_type` could be 'sitter' or 'dual'. `sitter_name` should be the ingame avatar nickname of the target gameworld.  
sitter information is optional.

```csv
your_email;your_password;your_gameworld;sitter_type;sitter_name
```

pull image and start the container mounting the file:

```console
$ docker pull scriptworld/king-bot-api
$ sudo bash ./docker.sh
```
the docker script will prompt you for a container name, what port you want the bot to run on and the absoulute path to the folder you just created.

visit `http://localhost:3000` (or whatever port you chose) to see the results.

# development

if you wanna use the command `npm run dev` or `npm run watch` you need to insert your credentials into `dev_main.js`.  
you can also create a file names `cred.txt` in the root folder which contains your login credentials:

```csv
your_email@mail.com;your_password;your_gameworld
```

this file will be ignored by git so you don't have to be scared to accidentally commit your credentials.

create a file names `own_main.js` which is going to be ignore by git, you can modify it as you wish, without pushing your custom feature set to github.
